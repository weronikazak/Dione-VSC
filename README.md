# Dione - Visual Studio Extension

What you will need:
- your personal Confluence API Token
- your OpenAI API key

## How to get started?

1. Install the extension.

2. Click `ctrl + shift + P` and look for ***Dione: Save Credentials***. Make sure you have your Confluence Token ready. **Use the email you use when logging in to Atlassian.** This is a one time step, you don't have to do it if you used the extension before.

3. Click `ctrl + shift + P` and look for ***Dione: Login***. This will take to an external website, where you will get remote access to your Confluence workspace through Dione.

4. Click `ctrl + shift + P` and find ***Dione: List Pages***. Choose the page you wish to see in your editor. The page is converted to Markdown by default.

5. In anoter tab, select the code snippet you want to document. Click right button on your mouse and choose ***Dione: Codify*** from the menu. You can do it multiple times.

6. When you're happy with your changes, click `ctrl + shift + P` again and choose ***Dione: Push Pages***. You should be able to see the changes in your Confluence.
